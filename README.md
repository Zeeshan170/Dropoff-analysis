## Project Overview

This project provides an interactive dashboard for analyzing lead funnel drop-off at various stages of an admission pipeline. It helps identify where leads are lost or converted, enabling stakeholders to optimize their follow-up strategies and improve overall conversion rates.

Using timestamped lead stage data enriched with metadata such as advisor, source, and program, the dashboard visualizes key funnel metrics and segment-wise breakdowns in an intuitive manner.

## Features

- Upload your own funnel data CSV to generate dynamic insights
- Visualize lead drop-offs and conversions across different funnel stages
- Segment analysis by advisor, lead source, program, and other dimensions
- Interactive and user-friendly charts for quick understanding
- Helps identify bottlenecks and optimize lead management strategies

---

## Dataset Format

The dashboard expects a CSV file containing at least the following columns:

- `Lead ID`: Unique identifier for each lead
- `Stage`: The current stage/status of the lead (e.g., New Lead, Contacted, Registered)
- `Timestamp`: Date/time when the lead reached the given stage
- `Advisor`: Assigned advisor or counselor handling the lead
- `Source`: Origin of the lead (e.g., Website, Referral, Campaign)
- `Program`: The program/course the lead is interested in (e.g., B.Tech, MBA)

You can find the sample dataset in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Zeeshan170/Dropoff-analysis/blob/main/data/funnel_data.csv).
